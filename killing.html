        <h1>Killing and Culling</h1>
        <p>Every Grim in the entire Grimosphere is either a Killer or a Culler. One of each are partnered up, and they work together during field missions to collect the souls of people who recently died in order to bring them to the Afterlife. For example, I am a Killer, and my partner Driggs is a Culler, and we work together during our shifts.</p>
        <p>The Killer's job is to extract the soul from the target, or the person who just died, which they do by simply touching the body. This causes the soul to fly out of the body, in which the Culler collects to bring to the Afterlife. Both people use their Scythes to enter the Ether, a place between the living and the dead, and travel to exact moment a person died. Time is frozen here, so you don't have to worry about running out of time, or being injured by any people and/or hazards around the target.</p>
        <p>Killing and Culling are important jobs that determine the future of many people, and as such there are many rules outline in the hefy Terms of Execution book. Breaking these can result in many consequences, the most notable of which being a memory wipe to forget this place exists and exile from the entire Grimosphere. So make sure to only Kill and Cull the assigned targets, and no one else.</p>
        <p>After your shift, you collect all the souls you have gathered and head to the Bank to depart them in the Afterlife.</p>

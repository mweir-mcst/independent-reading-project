        <h1>The Afterlife</h1>
        <p>The Afterlife is where all souls live after they die. Some souls tend to stay near the entrance that they first entered; I've overheard many interesting conversations between Edgar Allan Poe and Alexander Graham Bell. Croak's gate to the Afterlife is located on the upper floor of the Bank.</p>
        <p>The entrance to the Afterlife is guarded by two Junior Grims: Ferbus on the outside and Elysia on the inside. Ferbus makes sure no one gets in who shouldn't get in gets in, and Elysia watches over the Afterlife to make sure everything is going well.</p>
        <p>After every shift, all Grims head here and drop off the souls they collected. You may be tempted to talk to some newly admitted souls, but they usually don't understand that they died yet, so it just tends to create confusion among them.</p>
        <p>The Afterlife is also the source of Elixr, a substance that has many purposes, including as a strong beverage at Cripp's bar, but having too much of it can be problematic.</p>

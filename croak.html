                <h1>Town of Croak</h1>
                <p>Croak, with a population of only 82, may seem like a small town, but it plays an important role in the life (or, rather, the death) of humans: it's one of several Grimosphere hubs in the world. Grims from all over the East coast conglomerate here to do their jobs: safely transporting the souls of the dead to the afterlife.</p>
                <p>There are several places in town of interest, such as Corpp's bar and the Morgue, but by far the most important is the Bank, which serves as our headquarters of operation.
                <p>Inside the Bank are Norwood and Heliose, members of the Ether Traffic Control (ETC), or Etceteras as we call them. The Etceteras' job is to use the Smacks to control where we Scythe to during our field work, and they are some of the most important people in town. It also contains an entrance to the Afterlife, where us Grims go to drop off the souls we've Killed and Culled.</p>
                <p>Just past the bank, the road splits and on the left you can find my uncle Mort's house, where Driggs and I live. Uncle Mort is the mayor of Croak, and it's his job to not only keep the town in shape and make sure everyone is following the Terms of Execution, but also to recruit new Junior Grims. If you're reading this as an up-and-coming Grim, you may have met Mort before.</p>
                <p>To the right of the bank is the neighborhood, where everyone else lives. Slain Lane, which branches off from the center of town, houses all the local businesses in the area.</p>
